Hello,

Firstly, I would like to say thank you so much. This is a very nice opportunity and I'm pretty happy to be part of this process to work at Flix and to be honest I would be more happy to work at Flix and be part of Team.

Please, below take a look at some points that I have about the project and also an overview.

## What would I like to do?
- Apply cypress to implement e2e tests
- Implement a story for Tooltip. I've started, but I gave up, because of time and other priorities.
- Improve design

## Considerations
- This is really important to me, maybe because of this I took time until Wednesday and get/apply more details.
- Change time zone I had in my mind the select way, maybe this was expected or not.
- I would not like to use `create-react-app` because I would like to show that I'm able to start a project from zero and apply some webpack optimizations and control it.
- I think to create a folder only for `types` makes more sense to concentrate a repository for structure of my objects, class...
- The Data are coming from `API/` repository into `src/`
- I tried to follow the maxmimum instructions from the file and my focus was the quality code and also clean code for other developers.
- I'm using Material UI, however sometimes I prefer to use simple elements for part of component, this void depences.

I think tha's all, if I forgot something, I would be happy to talk in person =)
